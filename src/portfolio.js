        "My name is Jimmy Le, and I'm a junior studying computer science at Iowa State University. My interest in problem-solving began with AP Computer Science A in high school. After my freshman year at Iowa State, I underwent spinal fusion surgery, which limited my ability to pursue academic and professional opportunities during that summer. However, I have mostly recovered and started working as a part-time software developer for my university during my sophomore year. Additionally, from April to June 2024, I taught a section of 12 students using Stanford's CS106A curriculum through Stanford's Code in Place program.",
